Submarine Radar - Raylib

Description

The main objective of this project is to understand the core components of game engines, including elements involved in the execution such as the main loop, rendering system, and object pooling. Raylib assists in managing some of the more challenging aspects of game development from scratch, such as physics and asset management.

Programming Patterns Used:

- [X] Object Pool
- [X] Singleton
- [X] State Machine
- [ ] Visitor
- [ ] Factory
- [ ] Observer

Instructions:
The radar bar will appear and reveal obstacles in your path. Select the best route to avoid them and destroy them to gain points.

Controls:

A, D → Rotate
W → Move Forward
P → Pause
Space → Shoot

Future Changes:

Add a high score board.
Improve sprites for the player and obstacles.
Add more object pools for better resource management.
